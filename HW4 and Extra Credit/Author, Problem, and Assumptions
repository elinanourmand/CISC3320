The homework problem and extra credit is asking to write a program that implements the disk-scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SSTF, Scan, CScan, Look, and CLook. 
The program services a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0-4,999. A set of 50 requests has been provided. 
The initial position of the disk head is 100 and moving upwards. Each algorithm returns back the the total amount of head movement. 

Assumptions I had while doing this homework problem:
1. No need to circle back and reverse direction for CLook and CScan because the initial position of the disk head is the same as the smallest request. 
Therefore, the total head movements for CLook and Look are the same as well as CScan and Scan. 
2. We are able to sort the requests array before going through the requests.
