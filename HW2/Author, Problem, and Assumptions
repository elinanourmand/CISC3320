The author of this code is myself, Elina Nourmand.

The homework problem is asking to create a multithreaded program that tests HW1 (ie. PidManager).
Each thread will request a pid, put the pid to sleep for a random amount of time, and then release the pid. 
Multiple threads need to be created.

Assumptions I had while doing this homework problem:
1. HW1's Java code needs to be saved in the same package as HW2's Java code to ensure HW2 can call HW1's methods (ie. allocate_pid() and release_pid()).
2. If the Java code works for three threads, it will work for 100+ threads.
