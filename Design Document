The range of possible pid values are from constant MIN_PID=300 to constant MAX_PID=5000.

The function allocate_map(void) has no parameters and a return type int. It will initialize all pids from MIN_PID to MAX_PID to 0 using any data structure.
It will return 1 after completion. Please note- In a Zoom meeting with Professor Goldberg, he allowed me to leave out the return of -1. 

The function allocate_pid(void) has no parameters and a return type int. It will allocate 1 pid by assigning it to 1, activating a process. 
It will return the pid or -1 if all pids are in use. 

The function release_pid(int_pid) has int_pid as its parameter and a void return type. It will release int_pid and reset it to 0 to be able to be allocated to a new process. 
There is no error detection if the released pid is not allocated.
